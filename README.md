# Brief Description
We have implemented a generic STL like set using splay tree.This can work with a any datatype(provided the approp methods and operators are implemented) and user defined functors. 

We have implemented a forward iterator to traverse through the splay_tree

We have implemented most of the class methods and operators to effectively mimic a STL container such as insert, find, erase, etc.

We timed the code to get results for different cases and tabulated it.
